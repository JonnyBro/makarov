Listen up, I'm 'bout to teach y'all how to get some money
You can get the process done perfectly if you listen closely
This an in-store Best Buy pick-up method, listen to these steps
Open up your computer, but make sure you got that VPN
Once you did that, open your browser and head over to Google.com
Proceed to enter "Best Buy United States official site"
But listen up, I got one warning for everybody
Don't go onto the site using Internet Explorer
But once you on the site, these are the things you gotta do
Listen to all these steps if you want everything to go through
I know you tired of that bucket, you want a foreign expensive coupe
And you want a big house with a huge chimney roof
Once you on Best Buy, register account under the card holder's name
You gon' need all the information, the first, the last, and the middle name
But I got this one site where I be getting all my fullz from
Said you want some money, try this method, you'll have a lot of it
Once you signed up and you all ready to go
Go on Tor Browser and enter "dark.fill"
That's how you gon' find all the dark web links
I think it might be down, but click "Empire Market"
Grab a phone spoofer, now this where you 'bout to get started at
This will allow you to get card numbers and make phone calls
Then from there, go back to BestBuy.com
Put some electronics in the cart and start buyin'
Right after you order, call the cardholder's bank
Let the bank know you just placed an order online
To speed up the verification, say you need these items on time
'Cause my nerd son like playing video games
Choose a location in the suburbs, that's the pick-up spot
Then go clear the order through if you talked it over with the bank
Check your email for a code, should be a fifteen minute wait
Soon as it say "Approved," you should be walkin' up to the place
To pick the items up, get a fake ID made
So when they ask who it's for, you can say you pickin' up in your name
You should be leaving out the store with a lot of Xboxs and games
But make sure to play it off like you a regular civilian
Doing this for two or three years straight can make a million
Find a random guy or random place to cash you out at
If you desperate and need some money now, just go to the pawn shop

She was off her period, I told her, "Open legs now"
Treat your bitch like a dog and I told her, "Sit down"
The opps had a funeral, dig up the casket in the ground
Riding in a Hellcat, you in a box, old town
Walmart know my face, they keep saying, "Turn around"
I just went to Verizon, got approved zero down
Yeah, I seen you in there too, but you had a high deposit
Please hit my DM for SunTrust deposits
He tryna run off with the cheese, he just keep duckin' and dodgin'
But I got his address, so I'ma keep on sliding
My mama ran off with some cheese, I'm 'bout to go blow up her house
This shit really surprise me, niggas keep runnin' they mouth<i>[Intro]</i>
Trapboy3k
Rocket, you're so full of yourself

<i>[Verse]</i>
Bitch got her hair done, now she feelin' herself
He blowin' on some backyard boogie, this some top shelf
Why you sign a 360 deal that got you on a shelf?
Doctor said that I might die from drinkin' lean, I gotta watch my health
Got into a car accident and had to cut on my hazards
Made a fake GoFundMe then I lie like I had cancer
She tried to steal my ones, so I had to stab one of the dancers
This no cap, last year I scammed Lance Armstrong
He got a blue text, I think this nigga got a flip phone
Ate the meat off my steak then stabbed the nigga with my t-bone
My plug threw a few 'bows on me, Tim Tebow
I just beat the fuck out of a nigga like Kimbo
He ridin' in a foreign, but we know that that's a rental
They don't like to send me beats 'cause I kill instrumentals
In the Airbnb, man, this bitch is a penthouse
But I was tryna smoke weed inside and got kicked out
I was tryna smuggle weed in school and got kicked out
The bitch thought that we was 'bout to chill, I pulled my dick out
Tried to bring a bitch inside my mama crib and got cussed out
He think he sweet 'cause he got some buffs on, so I snatched 'em off
I just got head from your bitch, then I stabbed off
This nigga just keep lyin' to me, put your cap on
Pussy nigga, why you callin' my phone talkin' tough tone?
He mad at his bitch 'cause my song is her ringtone
Got it out the mud and I still got ringworms
Cut into my nigga like, "Bro, watch your fingers"
Before Roddy Ricch I been ballin' every season
Nigga claim he been ballin', ain't even play the whole season
All you gotta do is listen to my music, I be teachin'
Bought a four of red and I dropped it in the Tahitian
My mama kicked me out 'cause she said that I'm a heathen
Tired of this Scat Pack, I'm 'bout to go and buy a Demon
The way she suck my dick, man, this bitch is a demon
This shit so crazy 'cause she ate all my semen
He can't find no lean so this lil' nigga fiendin'
Kick me in the cold and they left a nigga freezin'
He ridin' in the bucket, man, that bitch need some freon
Beat a nigga ass and I think his name was Deon
Don't compare yourself to me, lil' nigga, you a peon
Shot a nigga in the bathroom stall while I was peein'
Was scared to go inside the airport 'cause I was reekin' loud
They heard that one song, they better let me perform at Rolling Loud
Do some crazy shit, I'm 'bout to come kidnap a child
Stomp a nigga head in on my marble tiles
I don't got no rope so I tied him up with some towels
Seen a nigga that I scammed at my family reunion
I done made a hundred thousand out of Western Union
You can't tell me that you gettin' money, nigga, who you foolin'?
Bought a chain before a whip, nigga, you so backwards
You still thinkin' 'bout the past, now we movin' forward
I'm really doin' fraud shit, I gotta get a lawyer
I'm mad as fuck, I got some blood on my new sneakers
He tried to get a song with me and I scammed the nigga for a feature
I only rolled three grams inside a 'Wood and she fascinated
The feds took twenty thousand from me, I was frustrated
Shoot a nigga twenty times and the doctor said he didn't make it

<i>[Outro]</i>
Trapboy3k<i>[Chorus]</i>
Told my plug send some bows to the address
And they touched down to me, God bless
Sent his bank login, got access
Fucked his bitch in the trap on the mattress
Big strap on me, right now I ain't scrappin'
I just caught one of these pussy niggas lackin'
On the run 'cause I gotta fed case in Lexington
Ain't no hoes in the party then you know I'm 'bout to exit it
Sittin' at the front door and I'm waitin' on the mailman
White-collar crime, I ain't tryna go to jail, man
And I'm blowin' on some exotic
Whippin' on the pot, no Betty Crocker
Chillin' in the hood playin' cops and robbers
I been gettin' money since a toddler
Bitch on my dick so I'm 'bout to pop her
Nigga tried to rob me so I popped him
Big ass wood, I need a lighter
Big ass strap, I'm not a fighter
Made twenty thousand off the pied piper
Spin the SRT, I need some tires (Skrrt)
Not gettin' money, you a liar
Said you high, but, boy, I'm higher
Gettin' bigger, gettin' higher
Just killed a nigga with my fire (Bitch)
Told my plug send some bows to the address
And they touched down to me, God bless
Sent his bank login, got access
Fucked his bitch in the trap on the mattress
Big strap on me, right now I ain't scrappin'
I just caught one of these pussy niggas lackin'
On the run 'cause I gotta fed case in Lexington
Ain't no hoes in the party then you know I'm 'bout to exit it
Sittin' at the front door and I'm waitin' on the mailman
White-collar crime, I ain't tryna go to jail, man
And I'm blowin' on some exotic
Whippin' on the pot, no Betty Crocker
Chillin' in the hood playin' cops and robbers
I been gettin' money since a toddler
Bitch on my dick so I'm 'bout to pop her
Nigga tried to rob me so I popped him (Bitch)
Big ass wood, I need a lighter
Big ass strap, I'm not a fighter
Made twenty thousand off the pied piper
Spin the SRT, I need some tires
Not gettin' money, you a liar
Said you high, but, boy, I'm higher
Gettin' bigger, gettin' higher
Just killed a nigga with my fire

<i>[Verse]</i>
Got a new strap and I can't even aim
I just fucked a bitch, she ain't even know my name
Bitch irritating, say I let her play the game
But I fuck with you more than 2K
Sittin' on his ass, he ain't made 2k
I just made ten thousand today
Met up with my plug and I made a new play
I just fucked your bitch and I bought her shirts, ayy
Mexican plug and his name Jorge
But I cut him off 'cause he was low-ballin'
Met a new white boy and his name Austin
And it's so crazy 'cause he live in Austin
Pour green lean, you should move to Boston
New drip on me, I look like a faucet
Went on Amazon and bought a new embosser
Nigga talkin' crazy, he a private caller
'Bout to get rich and buy a Rolex
Just seen this nigga postin' throwbacks
Fucked your bitch and told her "Throw it back"
Opps see me out, they have a heart attack
If it's 'bout some money then I'm part of that
Got a bad batch and I sent it back
I ain't like your bitch so I sent her back (Bitch)(My nigga Lee I think we got another one)

Bust a BOA, for thirty thousand, all my niggas havin' cheers
We sellin' bread with an AR, we sellin' bread with some beers
I'm top smokin' loud, this shit fuckin' with my ears
At my crib in the burbs, I just ran into some deers
Your power steerin' fucked up, you can't even steer
Need somebody to open up a Chase, call my phone to volunteer
Knock his head off, like we playin' volleyball
My auntie call my phone like, "Can you sell these Adderalls?"
Was 'bout to put them on the plane, but I don't think he got the balls
Why you run off with my money, you motherfuckin' bastard
I just fucked a bitch 'cause she thought that I was Casher
Plus I stole her ID and she didn't even notice
Kanye, Jay-Z scammed a nigga named Otis
Bought a rocket launcher and this bitch is atrocious
Got a new rental and this bitch is a Focus
I was bored as hell, back in school, couldn't even focus
My worker just broke a BOA, gave him a bonus
Bought a profile, and I think it's Nick Jonas
Just 'cause you don't have no weed, don't try to pass me no till
Fucked her from the back and pulled out her ponytail
It was five hundred dollars just to log-on to Yale
I don't care if you're a bitch, I'll scam a female
Told me that he gettin' money, we know that's a fairy tail
They ask me how I'm doin', bitch, I'm doin' very well
I just caught this nigga ridin' in an old Impala
It costs to get in the party, and you ain't even got a dollar
One time I scammed a Muslim and he called me sayin', "Allah!"
Just stole a credit card and it belonged to my mama
Wrapped a white shirt around my head, feel like Osama
Told the Jew to send a thousand, and I'ma add two commas
Bought a fake wig, now I look like John Stockton
I heard a nigga said he want some beef, let's get it poppin'
Deposit a fake check inside the bank, that bitch poppin'
Give you 13 on my Glock, imma rock it
You can get rich fuckin' with the stock market
It's really just my weed, but they think somebody farted
I just slapped the fuck outta my cousin, he retarded
He don't fuckin' listen, man, this nigga so stupid
Amiri's, offered Jordans, boy, you look so stupid
I cannot fall in love, bitch, I am not cupid
Feel like Juice WRLD, 'cause my dreams so lucid
Runnin' to my old teacher, man, I hate John Lucas
Tryna lock us up in jail, it's a fucked up institution
I'm tryna quit doin' fraud and just focus on my music
But man, I swear that shit ain't as fuckin' easy as it sounds
Was tryna make a rap song but nigga called for a pound

Hello? Yeah, lemme get a pound. alright where you at? Shit, I'm on 7 Road. Alright, here I come. For sure.

And you really think that I was 'bout to turn that shit down?
I just pulled up on my bitch like, "Come outside now"

What's good? Hello. Come your ass outside.(Helluva made this beat, baby)

My alarm said, "Wake up, and get it" that's a daily reminder (Get it)
A nigga try to take somethin' it's gon' be a problem

Knew how to scam when I came out, it's in my bloodline (For real)
Set my alarm, 'cause this check drop at sunrise

Still be in the hood, that's the only time I'm comfortable (The only time)
She walked inside my crib, I said, "Go ahead, get comfortable" (Go ahead)
All these different bills in my role, this shit colorful
I just fucked a Haitian-ass-bitch from the color (Bitch)
So many different guns, can't even choose, unlocked category
Stairs in my basement, makin' fake checks in the laboratory (Come on)
I'm choosin' money over a bitch, that's mandatory (For real)
You all been through the struggle, I ain't tryna hear you tell your story
We in the suburbs makin' plays, it's time to act normal (Act normal)
She let me videotape, and fuck her, she ain't got no morals (Fuck morals)
Hate to break it to you, but that lil' bitch gave me oral sex
Can't give it to you over here, guess you can call me a lone court (Come on)
Been grindin' all day, feel like I'm on a skateboard (Grindin')
Just jugged a white nigga ridin' on a skateboard (Lame)
How the fuck you think you tough typin' on a keyboard? (How?)
Got kicked out of my house 'cause I scammed the landlord (What the fuck?)
Think I just seen my face, oh shit, change the channel (Damn)
Since we on the swipin' tour might as well stop at Apple (Come on, bro)
Pay for flights, have a jug handle the traffic
I'm tryna hurry up and go but the jug just canceled (Damn)

My alarm said, "Wake up, and get it" that's a daily reminder

Pussy nigga say he want some beef, hit him with A1 (Pussy)
I don't think that's no weed in this blunt, he smokin' K2 (Lame)
They treat my niggas like dogs in that bitch, givin' 'em jail food (What the fuck?)
You wanna buy exotic homegrown when I'ma sell you
You wanna lower price? I need it all, that's your answer (Nope)
I just threw a bullet at a nigga like Matt Stafford (Catch that)
Now I'm gettin' nervous 'cause I'm walkin' to the cashier
We like robbin' niggas, I hope you don't walk past here (Bitch)
He heard the operation, gotta shoot the nigga in both ears
A hundred out the bank, you could see it with your own eyes (God damn)

My alarm said, "Wake up, and get it" that's a daily reminder

(Beatgang)I just wrote this verse on the plane
I'm on tour right now
I usually don't write, but
Tell me what y'all think about this

I got on some black Forces, see me out, that's my appearance
Life don't last long, you better go and get insurance
My music not ass, you just got your own opinion
Money get me high, I don't got a drug addiction
Get up out my bed early, gotta be productive
Limited edition black Forces made custom
When the jugg call, I just hit decline button
They tried to pull us over, search the car, ain't find nothing

Scammin' for a hundred really just a petty hustle
Bury all my money before I die, need a shovel
You can lose it all in one day, so stay humble
It's hard to trust niggas, so I stay away from 'em
Seen a transaction say, "Approved," it was beautiful
All the closest people to me dying, it's not usual
Lately, I been dressing up, going to different funerals
Smile on my face, but inside I'm really miserable
Niggas want my spot, but it's really not possible
My opps want me dead, but it's clear I'm unstoppable
They charged me with theft and I'm not even responsible
Left no evidence, played it all off phenomenal

I got on some black Forces, see me out, that's my appearance
Life don't last long, you better go and get insurance
My music not ass, you just got your own opinion
Money get me high, I don't got a drug addiction
Get up out my bed early, gotta be productive
Limited edition black Forces made custom
When the jugg call, I just hit decline button
They tried to pull us over, search the car, ain't find nothing

I can still make a few thousand on a slow day
It's hard beating the odds when you come from nothin' anyway
Just make you wanna pack all your clothes up and run away
I'm fucked up in the head, get suicidal thoughts every day
Two thousand for the sauce, another band for the ingredients
Let's talk about the present time, the shit you did was previous
But I had to slow down 'cause they caught a nigga one time
Went back to the banks 'cause they always the easiest
Plus I got on some Amiri jeans and they slim-fit
And I poured up some Hi-Tech 'cause I feel sick
He just bust his first bank play, so he feel rich
I really think niggas paralyzed, I don't feel them

I got on some black Forces, see me out, that's my appearance
Life don't last long, you better go and get insurance
My music not ass, you just got your own opinion
Money get me high, I don't got a drug addiction
Get up out my bed early, gotta be productive

Somebody asked, "Have I ever got declined once? ", never
I'm a veteran at fraud, I think you on rookie level
Listen to these songs and learn some free methods, 'cause it's helpful
You keep on tryna swipe, but it ain't go through, so you stressful

Drain his bank account, now it's negative with zeros
But all you gotta do is just call and get it reimbursed
My nigga fucked up this plate for us, gotta re-rehearse
Before you sign a label contract, you gotta read it first
Long fraud bible, you will get rich if you read all the pages
You will get rich the first time you swipe, go through the rookie stages
Couldn't imagine this shit, now I'm on the Rolling Loud stages
So next year, now I'm aimin' for Coachella
I hope a nigga that I scammed would try to come and shoot up one of my shows
She look real familiar, think that's one of my hoes
That sound real familiar, think he stealin' my flow
That look real familiar, think he stealin' my clothes
Seen yo' new outfit, you need to throw it away
Please don't tell me you spent yo' money on that shit today
Goin' in public, so I gotta bring my stick today
Shot myself, 'cause I didn't make shit today
He had that same outfit on since yesterday (Hahahaha)
I ain't make no new roll, this the same money from yesterday
Got some goofy hoes, so I gotta ignore my bae
Ran off with his money, and I ignored his face

I just got offered 20 million from DefJam
But I declined it because I make more off scammin'
He just tried to send me 7, 000 through CashApp

Me and bro fuckin' with them cards, no Uno
Got a hundred K in a week when we dropped "Dynamic Duo"

<i>[Teejayx6:]</i>
I'm 'bout to catch this nigga on his bike like Lil JoJo
I just met up with a Mexican and he said, "What up, loco?"
I'm tryna shoot a fire visual, call Coco
I got your bitch jerking on my dick like a pogo

<i>[Kasher Quon:]</i>
I just touched down like Chad Ochocinco
I just asked my bitch, "What you botherin' me for?"
I just beat a nigga ass like Craig did Deebo
You an Instagram comedian, Eastside Ivo

<i>[Teejayx6:]</i>
Bitch, keep tryna start shit with me, you gon' be single
Lame nigga made an account on LetsMingle

<i>[Kasher Quon:]</i>
His bitch in my DM like, "Hey, I wanna meet you"
A nigga fucked up, I swear I wouldn't want to be dude
I just want to fuck, lil' bitch, ain't mean to be rude
Nigga think he gon' come up off basement tattoos
I just fucked a grown lil' bitch with thirty tattoos
You just fucked a dirty ass bitch that smell like a raccoonAlright I know we in a pandemic, I know that
But I'm 'bout to help y'all out
This how you get some money

Worldwide pandemic and everybody need money
So I'ma teach y'all how to do the unemployment
Donald Trump closing everybody business down
So I'm teach y'all how to get some free money
First you gotta load yo' site up to buy a full
If you don't know that lingo that's the full name, address, social security number, date of birth, drivers license, and or email address
But always make sure that you got on a good SOCKS
Or any VPN used for online jobs
I got this one site called ssndob.cm/login
That's the sites where you can get the fullz from
Cause I know you tired of them niggas in the telegram chats calling you a lil bum
So take this method my nigga and run yo' bands up
If you don't trust that site I got a telegram vendor you can buy from directly
And a fake ID generator with some plugins that I built myself
Already made a M off unemployment I might as well share the wealth
Alright listen, this where it's 'bout to get real complicated
Some states only have one links for the fill-ins, general unemployment portal, direct PUA portal
If the states you apply for has two links, then go directly to the direct unemployment portal, and file for assistance
Y'all better be taking this shit down as I'm saying it
Like I said, I already ran up a big bag off this shit
EDD changing everybody life right now
For example, if you get a Virginia full it's like two links
That state so fucking green that shit'll pull up like 2 millions
If you made it through you at the unemployment status so listen closely
If you file for unemployed, you get a higher amount of money
They tend to show favor to all the people who are self employed
Cause they know during this coronavirus nobodies getting no income
If you are asked how much you earned annually last year, make sure the amount you mention is between 16, 850 and 42, 100
The higher amount you make the better
If you chose self employed and they ask what job you do for a living, tell them you are a professional photographer and you take professional photos at weddings and parties for a living
Also, if they ask you how the COVID-19 affected your occupation, just tell them you were booked for weddings and parties for the whole year
Alright, that should be enough to put me in jail(Marc Boomin)

Niggas askin' why my pants saggin'
Probably 'cause of this Glock.23, I'm never lackin'
Bitch keep callin', tryna ask what's our current status
Run into your crib like I need everything, rip up the whole mattress
The IRS gon' have to come and get me, I ain't payin' taxes
Niggas workin' for a job everyday, checkin' in with master
He was already down, I shot him again, he checked out faster
Tell a label come with a hundred million, they can have my masters

What the fuck I just say?

None of my plays goin' through, it is just not my day

I got it, I got it

I'll make a nigga beatbox, SpotGottem
Oh, you need some weed, drank, and Percs? Pull up, the spot got it
This nigga said he wanna drive the weed back, just lobby it
Remember bein' twenty deep in the hood just mobbin'
My lil' niggas be slidin' everyday while they dodgin'
When I get my foot in the industry, I'ma dominate
I got some indoor bowls for 23, but they half shake
Shot a nigga in his right arm, now he half bake
I got on Supreme and Louis V, the one collab they made
Every time a nigga tell a story, he over exaggerate
It's crazy, a nigga will run off over a lil' pape
But you know I ain't trippin' 'cause I still got a full plate
She asked for my number and I gave the bitch the full eight
Throw the Glock to my mans, he gon' pull that bitch like Clay
Think I need a money counter, I've been countin' shit all day
I done made at least five to ten racks in each state, count that up

I keep fuckin' forgettin' my bars
Punch me-, no, no, no, don't punch me in, man
Fuck this-, I'm leavin', I'm leavin', man
Fuck this
Alright, I'm 'bout to come out thereUndefined

If I get rich off this music, then we all eat
Just might as well call me Calboy, cause they envy me
Be careful when you play my mixtape, cause that bitch is heat
I left her DM on read cause that bitch a freak
See why your mama called you sugar, cause you niggas sweet
I'm about to drop my location, pull up, we can meet
I'm getting head, counting $20, 000 in the suite
Since I been fucking with them punches, everything been free
We be in the club poppin' bottles, everything on me
We roll Runtz and platinum cookie, we don't smoke OG
If you playin' 'bout my money, then it's OV
My dawg sitting in your bushes, chillin' lowkey
Throw him couple hunnid, he gon' do it while I'm OT
He got a Call of Duty weapon, that bitch OP
Tried to pay my hoes to stop callin', they just won't leave
You ain't got enough of Backwoods, you just roll leafs
They don't want to send you no more snippets, cause you steal beats
My dawg doing time in the same prison as Big Meech
Paid too much for this fit, I'm a walkin' puddle
I just fuck her, then I leave, I don't even cuddle
You need to give up tryna swipe, it seem like it ain't for you
She just keep on cheatin' on you, it seem like she don't love youI was just spending that shit on, like, dumb shit. I wasn't even smoking back then. I was a lil ass boy, so I was just spending it on Jordans and shirts and shit, like lil kid shit
Yup
Movies and shit
When did you start progressing past that?
When I was like twelve. That's when I started stacking

Just found a new site and this bitch is a gold mine
When I get rich I'ma go back and do some fraud for the old times
Got a record label cosign, his hairline look like LeBron
Said he rich, ain't got a dime
At the courthouse tryna pay my fine
Scrolling down on facebook, I finessed an old lady (damn)
Heard his watch ticking I think he got a fake timepiece
Fucked yo' bitch while in jail, I'm Jody, you Rodney
Was slipping at the store with no strap and they robbed me (trippin)
Made a million off of fraud, I think it's time to retire
The opps took one of my mans, I still wanna get revenge
Bitch I made my first ten thousand when I ten
You broke as hell tryna rob for some Cartier lens
Listen to Swipe Lesson 2 if you want some fucking BINS
Today I scammed a nigga and the dude was named Brent (Bitch!)
Riding in a rental and this bitch got tint
Fucked a nigga bitch because she ain't got nobody to vent to
Got booked for a strip club (and I scammed) the venue
That's not really your whip so stop pretending like it is
They all feeling my flow, I think I really started a trend
Shot a nigga off camera, then got on ESPN
